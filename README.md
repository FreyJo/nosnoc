# NOS-NOC
**NOS-NOC** is open source software package for NOnSmooth Numerical Optimal Control.
It is a modular tool for numerically solving optimal control problems with piecewise smooth systems (PSS). It relies on the recently introduced Finite Elements with Switch Detection (FESD) which enables high accuracy optimal control of PSS. The time-freezing reformulation, which transforms several classes of systems with state jumps into PSS is supported as well. 
Hence, it enables the treatment a broad class of nonsmooth systems in a unified way. The algorithms and reformulation yield nonsmooth nonlinear programs (NLP), which can be solved with techniques of continuous optimization in a homotopy procedure, without the use of integer variables.

## Installation

**NOS-NOC** requires CasADi versions 3.5.5.

Currently, a `MATLAB` version is avilable. Versions to come will support a `python` interface as well.
### Instalation for MATLAB


x = ca.MX.sym('x',<insert state dimension>) # states

1.  Install  `CasADi` and make sure it is added to your `MATLAB` path:

     For installation instructions follow this [link](https://web.casadi.org/get/)
   
    
2.   Clone this repository and add it to your `MATLAB` path:

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/nurkanovic/nosnoc.git
     ```
	 
	 
## Using NOS-NOC

The interface of **NOS-NOC** is based on the symbolic modeling framework [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/).  
User inputs should be given as `CasADi` expressions `Function` objects.	 

minimal code example
```matlab
import casadi.* 
x = var
	[settings] = default_settings_fesd();  	
	settings.N_homotopy = 15;
	model = michael_schumacher_problem();
		[solver,solver_initalization, model,settings] = create_nlp_fesd(model,settings);
	[results,stats,solver_initalization] = homotopy_solver(solver,model,settings,solver_initalization);
	plot_results(results,stats)
